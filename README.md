**My name is Ehtisham Sadiq, and I was born in Okara, now living in lahore, Pakistan.  I am a student of software engineering, with a strong  background in software development and programming. I have hands-on experience in various data analysis tools and techniques, such as Python, SQL, and machine learning algorithms. During my studies and internships, I have worked on projects that have helped me to develop the ability to solve complex problems. I have also gained experience in data visualization, data pre-processing, and model evaluation. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world problems and make an impact in the field of data science. In my free time, I enjoy cricket and music like qawali.**
